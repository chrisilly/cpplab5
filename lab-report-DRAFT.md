# Constructors

## `String(const char* value)`

First goal was to make the `String(const char* value)` and printing it to the terminal using the provided `operator<<` function.

> [!NOTE]
> It clicked implementing `operator<<` that in order to implement a `friend` function declared in a class in a header file, you need to drop the `MyClass::` prefix because the friend is *not* a member of the class.

1. I used `strlen()` to get the length of the `char* value` and assigned that value to the `String`'s private `size` variableâ€”representing the amount of characters in the string (excluding the `\0` null terminator)
2. I simply assigned `String`'s private `capacity` variable to be `= size + 10`
3. I then used `capacity` to initialize `text(new char[capacity] {})` and then used `std::memcpy` and `size` to copy over the content from `char* value` to my `char* text` valuable.

> [!NOTE]
> I've learned from **Twitch** chat that curly brackets at the end of array declarations *calls the array constructor*, which also means they won't contain garbage content lying around in memory.

Before discovering `std::memcpy` ([cppreference](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/), 2024) I tried using `std::strcpy` or iterating through the `char* value` and assigning each character in `text` individually which at the time became very non-functional when I wrote poor implementations of the copy-constructor and the assignment operator.

### main.cpp (for personal testing and debugging)
```cpp
String foo("FOO"), bar("BAR"), pie("PIE");
cout << "foo: " << foo << endl;
cout << "bar: " << bar << endl;
cout << "pie: " << pie << endl;
```

### output
```
foo: FOO 
bar: BAR 
pie: PIE
```

## Copy-constructor and Assignment Operator

The copy-constructor and assignment operator works similarly. Due to my misunderstanding some inner workings of C++, my copy-constructor at one point consisted of just the line `*this = other`; The thinking was that this would call the custom assignment operator and do everything I'd intended there instead of (almost) duplicating code.

### Assignment operator

1. Delete `text` (if it's not already capable of holding the right hand side value `other.text` within its own capacity) and allocate a new, bigger spot on the heap.
2. Re-initialize the `String` variables using `other`'s variables and call `std::memcpy` 

```cpp
if(capacity < other.size) 
{
    delete[] text;
    this->capacity = other.capacity;
    text = new char[capacity];
}

this->size = other.size;
std::memcpy(text, other.text, size);
```

The copy-constructor is not much different aside from not having anything to delete; It always initializes the new `String` variables with `other`'s variables.

### main.cpp (for personal testing and debugging)
```cpp
String foo("FOO"), bar("BAR"), pie("PIE");
cout << "foo: " << foo << endl;
cout << "bar: " << bar << endl;
cout << "pie: " << pie << endl;
String foo2(foo);
cout << "foo2: " << foo2 << endl;
foo = pie;
pie = bar;
cout << "foo: " << foo << endl;
cout << "bar: " << bar << endl;
cout << "pie: " << pie << endl;
cout << "foo2: " << foo2 << endl;
```

### output
```
foo: FOO 
bar: BAR 
pie: PIE 
foo2: FOO
foo: PIE 
bar: BAR 
pie: BAR 
foo2: FOO
```

# `push_back` and `reserve`

`push_back` simply compares `size` and `capacity`, calls `reserve` whenever needed, and adds the new character while incrementing `size`; `text[size++] = character;`.

`reserve` is similar to our assignment operator in the sense that it **deletes** our `text` and allocates space for a new, bigger array on the heap. The key difference is that `reserve` allocates the space in a `char* newData` variable *first*, and copies the `text` content over before deleting so as to preserve the data. This is obviously not an issue in the assignment operator logic where the data is meant to be replaced.

### main.cpp (for personal testing and debugging)
```cpp
// test push_back
for (size_t i = 0; i < 20; i++)
    foo2.push_back('A');

cout << "foo2: " << foo2 << endl;
```

### output
```
foo2: FOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
